# The Dark Energy Principle

## Overview
This repository contains the core materials for *The Dark Energy Principle: A Falsifiable Reinterpretation of Relativity’s Invariant*.  
The principle proposes that the universal invariant speed is not the speed of light, but the speed of dark energy, denoted \(c_{DE}\).  
Photons are contingent travelers whose effective speed depends on cosmic environment, producing achromatic delays that scale with path length and mean offset.  

This repo provides:
- 📄 The LaTeX manuscript (paper/dark_energy_principle.tex)
- 📊 Colab notebook with simulations (notebooks/photon_delays.ipynb)
- 📈 Figures generated from simulations (figures/)
- 📚 References and derivations (Appendix: Formalism)

## Key Equation
The operational law is:

\[
\Delta t \approx \frac{L}{c_{DE}} \mu
\]

where:
- \(L\) = path length  
- \(\mu = \langle n_\gamma - 1 \rangle\) = mean offset along the sightline  
- \(c_{DE}\) = invariant speed of dark energy
